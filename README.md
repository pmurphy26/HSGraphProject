Project Description
-----------------
This is a project that I created for my post AP Data Structures and Algorithms class as a senior in high school. We spent some time learning about both graphs and digraphs before creating the code for one. We didn't learn about paths and dijkstra's algorithm until after we had created the code for this otherwise I would have liked to implement my searching algorithms in a different way. 

The program's main class prints out a randomly made graph of 25 nodes, and the shortest path from the first created node to the node containing the value of 5 in it. The nodes are printed in the following format:
data (Color, leftnode, rightnode)
